        "cve_description": "The threat actors behind the RedTail cryptocurrency mining malware have added a recently disclosed security flaw impacting Palo Alto Networks firewalls to its exploit arsenal. The addition of the PAN-OS vulnerability to its toolkit has been complemented by updates to the malware, which now incorporates new anti-analysis techniques, according to findings from web infrastructure and security company Akamai. The attackers have taken a step forward by employing private crypto-mining pools for greater control over mining outcomes despite the increased operational and financial costs, security researchers Ryan Barnett, Stiv Kupchik, and Maxim Zavodchik said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. The infection sequence discovered by Akamai exploits a now-patched vulnerability in PAN-OS tracked as CVE-2024-3400 (CVSS score: 10.0) that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the firewall. A successful exploitation is followed by the execution of commands designed to retrieve and run a bash shell script from an external domain that, in turn, is responsible for downloading the RedTail payload based on the CPU architecture.",

Previous attacks disclosed by the cybersecurity agency have involved the use of malicious attachments sent via the Signal instant messaging app to deliver COOKBOX, a PowerShell-based malware capable of loading and executing cmdlets.The latest campaign detected by Cloudforce One in mid-April 2024 involves the use of Cloudflare Workers and GitHub, alongside the exploitation of WinRAR vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-38831.

The attack, at its core, capitalizes on legitimate DNS features such as query rate limits, query-response timeouts, query aggregation, and maximum response size settings to create timed floods of responses using a maliciously designed authority and a vulnerable recursive resolver. \"DNSBomb exploits multiple widely-implemented DNS mechanisms to accumulate DNS queries that are sent at a low rate, amplify queries into large-sized responses, and concentrate all DNS responses into a short, high-volume periodic pulsing burst to simultaneously overwhelm target systems,\" Xiang Li, a Ph.D. candidate at the Tsinghua University NISL Lab, said.",

        "cve_description": "New Flash Player zero-day comes inside Office document Update (2018-02-06): Adobe has released a patch for this vulnerability. More information is available here. We tested this zero-day with a proof-of concept that was made available. Rather than launching it from within Office, we turned it into a drive-by download attack. The animation below shows Malwarebytes blocking the exploit, and when the anti-exploit protection module is disabled, we can see the calculator launching. A new Flash Player zero-day has been found in recent targeted attacks, as reported by KrCERT. The flaw, which exists in Flash Player 28.0.0.137 and earlier versions, allows an attacker to remotely execute malicious code. On February 1, Adobe published a security advisory acknowledging this zero-day: Adobe is aware of a report that an exploit for CVE-2018-4878 exists in the wild, and is being used in limited, targeted attacks against Windows users. These attacks leverage Office documents with embedded malicious Flash content distributed via email. Threat actors used a decoy Microsoft Excel document to lure their intended target (some South Korea users) in order to infect them with a remote administration tool named ROKRAT. While not obvious at first, an ActiveX object has been embedded into the document and contains the Flash exploit. Highlighting cells reveals a small white rectangle that represents the embedded object: Upon opening the spreadsheet, one of several South Korean websites will be contacted via a GET request containing the following three parameters: a unique identifier the Flash Player version the Operating System version This is an important step because it retrieves a key used to decrypt the malicious shell code.  By the time we had access to this sample, the websites hosting it were down, which proved to be a showstopper in the exploitation and payload. Malwarebytes detects the remote administration tool that was dropped, as well as blocks the sites known to have hosted the key and payload. Adobe has said it will issue a patch for this zero-day sometime during the week of February 5. In the meantime, users are advised to disable or uninstall the Flash Player. We expect that this exploit will be used in larger scale attacks, including via malicious spam. We will keep you updated of any further developments.

        "cve_description": "Botched Flash 0day Gets Patched Adobe has just released a patch for the infamous Flash Player to fix a vulnerability actively exploited in the wild by some exploit kits. This vulnerability was actually a zero-day (CVE-2016-1019) but exploit kit authors botched its integration which resulted in only affecting older versions of Flash. Another saving grace was the fact that a “mitigation introduced in Flash Player 21.0.0.182 currently prevents exploitation of this vulnerability, protecting users running Flash Player 21.0.0.182 and later“. Nonetheless, since this could be tweaked and made functional to work on fully patched versions as well, Adobe went on to fix the bug. The Magnitude EK which has been very active as of late was in fact using CVE-2016-1019 for some time. As we reported earlier this month, several (still) active malvertising campaigns are pushing Magnitude with a little tweak, including a fingerprinting gate right before the landing page. Magnitude EK: CVE-2016-1019 with Flash 20.0.0.306: The payload from this attack is the Cerber ransomware: CVE-2016-1019 is blocked by Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit: Drive-by download attacks that involve compromised sites or malvertising continue to leverage the Flash Player as the preferred piece of software for exploitation. As an end-user, you need to evaluate your situation and decide whether you should keep it installed or not. If you do, it is critical that you run an exploit mitigation tool in parallel due to the likelihood of zero-day attacks. In other words, the traditional advice to keep your software up to date is not sufficient when it comes to high risk plugins such as Flash. Malwarebytes customers running Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit were already protected against this latest zero-day.",
